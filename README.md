# Retail-Sales-Forecasting
Retail sales forecasting is the process of predicting future sales in retail businesses by analyzing historical data, market trends, and consumer behavior. It helps retailers plan inventory, allocate resources, and design strategies to stay competitive.
# 🛍️ Retail Sales Forecasting

This project aims to help a retail company optimize inventory management by accurately forecasting product sales using machine learning techniques. Inconsistent sales predictions often lead to overstock or stockouts, impacting revenue and customer satisfaction. By building a robust forecasting model, we aim to improve demand planning and provide actionable insights.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Retailers face challenges in predicting product demand, leading to inefficient inventory decisions. This project addresses the need for accurate sales forecasts to minimize stockouts and overstock situations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model to forecast product sales.
- Minimize inventory issues by improving forecast accuracy.
- Analyze seasonality, trends, and external factors influencing sales.

## 🧠 Key Tasks
1. Analyze historical sales data across products.
2. Preprocess data (handle missing values, outliers).
3. Engineer features (seasonality, trends).
4. Build time-series forecasting models.
5. Evaluate and fine-tune models for accuracy.

## 🥅 Goals
- Achieve at least **90% forecasting accuracy**.
- Reduce **stockouts by 15%** and **overstock by 10%**.
- Deliver insights for inventory optimization.

## 📦 Scope
- Data analysis and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and model development
- Model evaluation and optimization
- Insight generation and recommendations

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Time series models (SARIMAX, Prophet)
- Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
